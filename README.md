# Front-End Capstone

## Description
Whirly is a self-care app that allows users to curate a list of self-care ideas. The user will be able to use all CRUD functionality to create their list, including both a category for each item and an estimated amount of time for the activity. When the user finds themselves in need of some self-care, the user can use a filter to select a category and a time limit for the activity and then spin the wheel to choose a self-care activity. Future iterations can include a library of self-care options for users to choose from and a log of all activities completed.

### Feature List
- Curate a list of self-care ideas using CRUD functionality
- Spin a wheel to choose a self-care activity
- Filter your options from your list by time or category
- Browse a library of self-care options
- Track your self-care practices with a log of activities completed

Under construction now.

## Motivation
This year has been incredibly challenging for everyone. I have personally been working on building habits of self-compassion and taking care of myself to thrive during this pandemic. This app would allow me to create my own personal list that will help me on difficult days and introduces a bit of fun and spontaneity with the wheel.
